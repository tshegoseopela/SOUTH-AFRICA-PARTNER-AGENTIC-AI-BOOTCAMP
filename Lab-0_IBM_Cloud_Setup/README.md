# Lab:0 - IBM Cloud Setup

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
This pre-work lab is intended to check whether you've created the IBM cloud environment properly or not. 

These values are essential for running various hands-on exercises and labs throughout the bootcamp. Follow the below steps to create the above. 

## Step-1: Create IBMid account (if not created) 

If you've not created your IBM cloud account, please refer the link and create your IBM account with your corporate email id that you have provided us in the registration

[Create IBMid account](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibmid?topic=introduction)

## Step-2: Go to your email ID and join the IBM cloud account.

## ðŸ”” Note - By the end of this exercise, ensure you have securely saved the following credentials:
1. API Key
2. Project ID
3. Space ID

These credentials will be required at multiple stages throughout this bootcamp, so keep them handy for future use.
