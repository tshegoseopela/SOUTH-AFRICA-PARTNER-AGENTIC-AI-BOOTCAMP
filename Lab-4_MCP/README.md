## üîç Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a lightweight specification that enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with tools, maintain context across steps, and execute multi-turn tasks. It defines a standard format for:

- Tool registration and metadata
- Input/output message passing
- Context propagation between steps and agents

This makes MCP a foundational layer for **agentic AI systems**, ensuring consistency and interoperability across tools, APIs, and models.

### ‚úÖ Key Benefits
- Unified tool schema across frameworks
- Seamless agent-tool interaction
- Context preservation across multi-step workflows

### Follow the below steps to create a sample MCP tool and import it in Watsonx Orchestrate ADK. 

Pre-requisite: Install ADK (Refer - [Lab-3:Agent_Development_Kit](dubai bootcamp/ai-bootcamp-dubai/Lab-4:Agent_Development_Kit))
