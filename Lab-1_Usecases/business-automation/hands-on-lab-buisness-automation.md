## Use Case Description

The sales department of ABC Motor Corp, an automotive large player, when preparing sales proposals, they were spending a lot of time understanding the features of competing products and comparing them with their own products. ABC Motor Corp, needs an automated competitive analysis system to help their sales teams quickly identify and position their products against competitors. Traditionally, gathering competitor insights required extensive manual research, making it inefficient and prone to outdated information. Therefore, the goal of this use case is to create an AI enabled system that support the customer's competitive analysis and market research.

## Pre-requisites

- Check with your instructor to make sure **all systems** are up and running before you continue.
- Please go the through the [environment-setup](/environment-setup) guide for steps on API key creation, project setup, and related configurations.
- If you're an instructor running this lab, check the **Instructor's guides** to set up all environments and systems.

## Agent Lab - watsonx.ai

>**Note:** Before starting the Agent creation, ensure you have generated your API key of watsonx.ai instance. 

We will create one agent **Comparison Agent** in watsonx.ai's Agent Lab as part of this setup:  

From the Home page of watsonx, click on the Build an AI agent to automate tasks

5. Then you will go the the main deployment page select your agent from the list.
![Deployment agent](assets/ca_dep3.png)

6. Then copy the public endpoint stream one.
![Deployment agent](assets/ca_url.png)

Then let's go to Orchestrate and create other agent and import this agent in that.

## Orchestrate Agent

In Orchestrate, we will create our main agent, as outlined below:

### Product Agent

1. Go to the Orchestrate home page, click on the hamburger menu (‚ò∞), select Build, and then choose Agent Builder.
![Agent Builder](assets/agent_build_wxo.png)

2. Click on the Create Agent button.
![Create Agent](assets/create_wxo.png)

3. Select Create from scratch (as shown in image 1 below), enter your agent‚Äôs name `YOUR NAME - Product Agent`, provide a description (as shown in image 3), and then click the Create button (as shown in image 4).

   For Product Agent use the below description
        
   ```
   This agent is designed to search for a specified product and retrieve its details and features using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on the product catalog. It presents the information in a clear and structured format, ensuring systematic organization of key product data, making it easy to understand and use.
   ```
   ![Create from scratch](assets/product_scratch.png)

4. After the agent is created, navigate to the Knowledge Section.

   **Description:**
   ```
   Your knowledge base is the document that contains all the product-related information. All queries related to the product will be addressed using this document as the primary source.
   ```
   ![Knowledge](assets/product_knowledge.png)

5. Scroll down to the Knowledge section, then in the Document section, click on the Upload file button and upload [the product catalog](./assets/ABC_Motor_Product_Catalog.pdf).
![Upload file](assets/upload_file.png)

6. Scroll down to the Toolset section, then in the Agents section click on the Add Agent button.
![Add Agent](assets/add_agent_pa.png)

7. From the pop-up menu, select the Import.
![Add from local instance](assets/import_ca.png)

> **Note:** : We are now adding the Comparison Agent (an external agent) to the Product Agent, enabling it to delegate tasks to them.

8. On the next page, ensure that External Agent is selected (as shown in image 1 below). If it‚Äôs not already selected, please choose it, then click the Next button (as shown in image 2).
![Select External Agent](assets/external_agent_select.png)

9. On the next page, enter the following information:
      1. Provide: From the drop down select watsonx.ai.
      2. API key: Enter your watsonx.ai API key.
      3. Service instance URL: Enter the public endpoint URL of the agent that we copied in step 6.
      4. Display name: Enter the name of the agent with prefix your name. 
      5. Description: Enter the below description.
      6. Click on the Import Agent button.

**Description:**
   ```
   This agent is designed to search for competitive URLs of input product and compare the given compare the given data with additional information gathered from Google search results. Its task is to carefully analyze the input data, extract key insights, and identify both differences and similarities. The findings should be presented in a well-structured table format, making it easy to understand and compare the information at a glance.

   ```
   ![External Agent](assets/external_agent_setup.png)

10. Once the delegated agents are added, they will appear as shown in the image below.
![Delegation Agent](assets/agent_appear_delegation.png)

11. Scroll down to the Behavior section, add the description shown in image as 1, and then click the Deploy button as shown in image as 2.

      For Product Agent use the below description in Behavior Section.

      ```
      This agent is responsible for handling product-related queries using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on the product catalog.
      For general product queries, it retrieves structured information directly from the knowledge base.
      For queries involving URLs or web references or comparison, it delegates the task to the Comparison Agent.
      ```
      ![Behavior](assets/Product_agent_deploy.png)

> **Note:** : The Product Agent is now ready to handle product-related queries, delegating tasks to the Link Search Agent and Comparison Agent as needed.

## Experience Agents in Action
Follow the steps above, then try interacting with the use case using these sample queries:

1. Product Agent

   Ask the following questions to get responses from the Product Agent:
   ```
   What are the products of ABC Motors.
   ```
   ```
   Give me the info of Zenith X3.
   ```
   ![Product Agent Response](assets/chat_1.png)  

3. Comparison Agent

   To compare the retrieved data, ask:
   ```
   Give me URLs of the competitors of the above product and show me the comparison as well.
   ```
